# Poran Dip's Portfolio

My personal portfolio website – a small corner of the internet where I showcase the things I build and create.

## Features
- Project showcase  
- About me section (spoiler: I code, make music, and kinda think I’m cool 😎)  
- Amazing UI with custom glass components *(coming soon to NPM, hopefully)* and sleek animations  

Built with **React, Vite, TailwindCSS** (and a lot of 💚)  
Deployed on **Vercel**
